#### **1. Creating a Python Notebook**

- Create a new file in VS Code with the `.ipynb` extension for Python notebooks.
- Name files with numbers at the beginning for proper ordering (e.g., `01_Basic_Programming_Constructs.ipynb`).

---

#### **2. Constants and Literals**

- **Definition:** Constants are fixed values, also called literals, like `10` (integer) or `"Hello"` (string).
- **Examples of Numeric Constants:**
  ```python
  10  # Integer
  20.5  # Float
  ```
- **String Constants:** Enclosed in either single or double quotes.
  ```python
  "Hello World"  # Double quotes
  'Python'  # Single quotes
  ```
- **Concatenation of Strings:**
  ```python
  '10' + '20'  # Outputs: '1020'
  ```

---

#### **3. Variables**

- **Definition:** Variables are placeholders for values.
- **Assignment:**
  ```python
  a = 10  # Integer
  b = "Hello"  # String
  ```

---

#### **4. Rules for Naming Variables**

1. Must start with an alphabetic character (`a-z`, `A-Z`) or underscore (`_`).
   ```python
   a = 10  # Valid
   _a = 20  # Valid
   ```
2. Cannot start with a number.
   ```python
   1a = 10  # Invalid
   ```
3. Can include letters, numbers, and underscores after the first character.
   ```python
   student_name = "John"  # Valid
   student1 = 10  # Valid
   ```
4. Names are case-sensitive:
   ```python
   a = 10
   A = 20  # 'a' and 'A' are different variables
   ```

---

#### **5. Best Practices for Variable Naming**

- Use meaningful names based on context.
- **Examples for a Student Management System:**
  ```python
  student_id = 123
  student_name = "Alice"
  student_score = 95
  ```
- **Examples for a Movie Database:**
  ```python
  movie_title = "Inception"
  movie_director = "Christopher Nolan"
  ```
- Avoid using generic or non-descriptive names like `a`, `b`, `x`, `y` unless necessary.

---

#### **6. Example Code for Variables and Constants**

```python
# Numeric constants
num1 = 10
num2 = 20

# String constants
greeting = "Hello"
name = 'Python'

# Performing operations
result = num1 + num2  # Addition: 30
message = greeting + " " + name  # Concatenation: "Hello Python"
```

---

#### **7. Common Errors**

- Invalid variable names:
  ```python
  1name = "John"  # Error: Cannot start with a number
  ```
- Mismatched types:
  ```python
  10 + "20"  # Error: Cannot add integer and string
  ```

---

### Key Takeaways:

- Constants and variables form the foundation of programming.
- Always follow naming conventions and use descriptive variable names.
- Use Python notebooks effectively to learn and experiment with code interactively.
