## Introduction to Python Lists and Basic Operations

---

#### **1. Python Lists Overview**

A Python list is a collection of elements that can hold values of the same or different data types. Lists are mutable, ordered, and can be indexed for accessing individual elements or ranges of elements.

---

#### **2. Creating Lists**

```python
# Examples of lists
sales = [200, 300, 183, 142]  # List of integers
cities = ["New York", "San Francisco", "Mumbai", "Chennai"]  # List of strings
score = [85, 90, None, 78, "absent", 92]  # Mixed data types
```

---

#### **3. Accessing Elements**

- **Indexing**: Access elements using their position (index starts at `0`).

  ```python
  sales[0]  # Output: 200 (first element)
  sales[2]  # Output: 183 (third element)
  ```

- **Negative Indexing**: Access elements from the end.
  ```python
  sales[-1]  # Output: 142 (last element)
  sales[-2]  # Output: 183 (second last element)
  ```

---

#### **4. Slicing**

- Extract a range of elements using the `start:end` syntax:

  ```python
  sales[1:3]  # Output: [300, 183] (from index 1 to 2)
  ```

- **Omitting `start` or `end`**:
  ```python
  sales[1:]   # Output: [300, 183, 142] (from index 1 to the end)
  sales[:3]   # Output: [200, 300, 183] (up to index 2)
  ```

---

#### **5. List Properties**

- Lists can hold different data types:

  ```python
  score = [85, 90, None, 78, "absent", 92]
  ```

- Use `len()` to get the number of elements in a list:
  ```python
  len(sales)  # Output: 4
  len(cities)  # Output: 4
  ```

---

#### **6. Summing List Elements**

- If all elements in a list are integers, use the `sum()` function:

  ```python
  total_sales = sum(sales)  # Output: 825
  ```

- If a list has mixed data types, directly using `sum()` will raise an error:
  ```python
  total_score = sum(score)  # Throws an exception because of mixed types
  ```

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways**

1. Python lists are flexible and can hold elements of different types, but for certain operations (like `sum()`), consistency in data types is required.
2. Indexing and slicing provide powerful ways to access elements in a list.
3. Use built-in functions like `len()` and `sum()` for operations on lists with homogeneous data types.

#### **8. Next Steps**

The next lecture will focus on using **conditionals** and **loops** to handle mixed data types in lists and process them gracefully. These constructs will help filter, process, and aggregate list elements based on their type or value.
