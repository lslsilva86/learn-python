## Configuring Python 3.9 for PowerShell on Windows

This lecture explains how to configure the environment variables to enable Python 3.9 to be launched using PowerShell on a Windows machine.

---

#### Problem:

After installing Python 3.9, it could only be launched using the Windows search window, but not via PowerShell. Attempting to launch Python in PowerShell prompted an installation message for Python 3.10. This occurred because the system PATH environment variable was not updated with the Python installation path.

---

#### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Locate Python Installation Path**:

   - Open **File Explorer** (yellow icon) and navigate to the home directory (`C:\Users\<YourUsername>`).
   - Enable hidden files and folders by:
     - Clicking on "View" → "Show" → "Hidden Items."
   - Navigate to `AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39`.
   - Copy the directory path (`Ctrl+C`) where Python 3.9 is installed.

2. **Update the System PATH Environment Variable**:

   - Open the search bar and type **"Environment Variables"**.
   - Select **"Edit the system environment variables"**.
   - In the "System Properties" window:
     - Click on **"Environment Variables"**.
   - Under "System Variables," find and select **"Path"** and click **"Edit"**.
   - Add the copied Python path as a new entry:
     - Click **"New"** and paste the Python directory path.
   - Save changes by clicking **"OK"** multiple times.

3. **Validate the Configuration**:
   - Open a new PowerShell session (restart if already open).
   - Type `python` in the PowerShell terminal to launch Python 3.9.
   - Test the installation by executing a Python statement, e.g., `print("Hello, World!")`.

---

#### Outcome:

After updating the PATH environment variable with the Python 3.9 installation path, PowerShell successfully launched Python 3.9 without any issues.

---

#### Key Points:

- Always update the PATH variable to use Python via PowerShell or any other terminal.
- Restart PowerShell after making changes to environment variables for the changes to take effect.
- Validate the configuration by launching Python and testing a basic command.
