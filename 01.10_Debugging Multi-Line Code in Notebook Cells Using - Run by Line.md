## Debugging Multi-Line Code in Notebook Cells Using "Run by Line"

This lecture explains how to use the **"Run by Line"** feature in the VS Code notebook environment to debug multi-line code effectively. The feature allows step-by-step execution of code, making it easier to identify errors and understand the logic flow.

---

### Key Takeaways:

#### **1. Using "Run by Line" for Debugging**

- **Purpose:** Debug and understand the logic of multi-line code by executing one line at a time.
- **Steps to Use:**
  1. Place the cursor at the start of the cell.
  2. Click the **"Run by Line"** button (hover over the icon to find it).
  3. Observe how each line is executed step-by-step.
  4. Monitor variable states and outputs after each line in the interface.

#### **2. Example Code for Debugging**

```python
# Sample multi-line code
L = [1, "hello", None, 2, 4]
rest = 0

for i in L:
    if isinstance(i, int):
        rest += i
rest
```

- **Objective:** Sum integers from the list `L` while skipping non-integer elements.

---

### Debugging Walkthrough:

1. **Initial Setup:**

   - Define a list `L` with integers, a string, and `None`.
   - Initialize a variable `rest = 0` to hold the sum.

2. **Using "Run by Line":**

   - Execute the first line (`L = [1, "hello", None, 2, 4]`):
     - List `L` is created with 5 elements.
   - Execute the second line (`rest = 0`):
     - Variable `rest` is initialized to `0`.
   - Execute the `for` loop:
     - The first element (`1`) is assigned to `i`.
     - The condition `isinstance(i, int)` evaluates to `True`, and `1` is added to `rest` (new value: `1`).
   - Continue line-by-line:
     - For `"hello"`, the condition fails, and the loop skips to the next element.
     - For `None`, the condition fails again, and the loop skips further.
     - For `2`, the condition passes, and `2` is added to `rest` (new value: `3`).
     - For `4`, the condition passes, and `4` is added to `rest` (final value: `7`).

3. **Viewing Outputs:**
   - After each step, monitor the state of variables (e.g., `i`, `rest`) in the notebook interface.
   - Use the notebook's live feedback to track changes in real-time.

### Benefits of "Run by Line":

- **Understanding Code Logic:** Break down complex code into manageable steps for better comprehension.
- **Troubleshooting Errors:** Identify issues by observing variable states and logic flow.
- **Learning New Code:** Debugging external code snippets becomes easier using this approach.

### Best Practices:

1. **Restart and Clear Outputs:**
   - Restart the notebook and clear all outputs before debugging to ensure a clean state.
   - This prevents leftover variables from affecting the debugging process.
2. **Practice Debugging:**

   - Regularly use "Run by Line" to practice and become comfortable with debugging.
   - This skill will help in identifying and fixing issues faster in real-world scenarios.

3. **Apply Debugging to Learning:**
   - Use this feature to explore new code, experiment with logic, and understand how it works.

### Final Note:

The **"Run by Line"** feature is an invaluable tool for learning and debugging Python code in notebooks. With practice, you can effectively troubleshoot and understand complex code snippets, improving your Python skills significantly.
