## Installing Python 3.9 on Windows 11

This lecture provides step-by-step instructions for installing Python 3.9 on a Windows 11 machine, applicable to other versions like Windows 10 as well.

#### Steps for Installation:

1. **Visit Python's Official Website**:

   - Open a web browser (e.g., Edge or Chrome) and go to [python.org](https://www.python.org).
   - Navigate to the "Downloads" section.
   - Scroll down to find Python 3.9 and select the 64-bit Windows installer.

2. **Check System Compatibility**:

   - Ensure your system is 64-bit:
     - Open "File Explorer" and right-click on "This PC."
     - Select "Properties" to check if your system is 64-bit.

3. **Download and Install**:

   - Click on the "64-bit installer" for Python 3.9.
   - Locate the downloaded file in your system and double-click to start the installation.
   - Choose "Install Now" and let the installer complete the process.

4. **Validate Installation**:

   - Search for "Python" in the Windows search bar and open the Python app.
   - Test the installation by typing `print("Hello, World!")` in the Python CLI to ensure it executes successfully.

5. **Launching Python in PowerShell**:
   - Open "PowerShell" via the Windows search bar.
   - If Python does not launch in PowerShell, the system PATH needs to be updated to include Python.
   - Details on updating the PATH for Python will be covered in the next lecture.

By following these steps, Python 3.9 can be successfully installed and validated on a Windows machine. Configuration for using Python in PowerShell will be addressed separately.
