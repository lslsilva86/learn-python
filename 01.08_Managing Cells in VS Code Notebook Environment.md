## Managing Cells in VS Code Notebook Environment

This lecture focuses on understanding and managing **cells** in the VS Code notebook environment, a crucial skill for writing and running Python code interactively.

---

### Key Takeaways:

#### **1. Cell Management**

- **Adding Cells:**
  - Use `+ Code` to add a code cell (default: Python programming language).
  - Use `+ Markdown` to add a markdown cell for documentation.
- **Deleting Cells:**
  - Click the **trash icon** next to a cell to delete it.

#### **2. Actions on Cells**

Each cell has the following controls:

- **Run by Line:** Executes the code line by line.
- **Execute Above Cells:** Runs all cells above the selected cell.
- **Execute Cell and Below:** Runs the current cell and all cells below it.
- **Split Cell:** Divides a cell into two separate cells.
- **More Actions:** Provides options like cut, copy, paste, and insert cells.

#### **3. Running Cells**

- Variables or functions must be defined in executed cells before dependent cells are run.
  - Example:
    - Defining `A = 10` in one cell and using `A` in another requires the first cell to be executed.
- **Execution Sequence:**
  - The sequence of execution is shown in square brackets (`[1]`, `[2]`, etc.).
  - Successful execution shows a **tick mark** and **execution time**.
- **Run All Cells:** Executes all cells in order, top to bottom.

#### **4. Clearing Outputs and Restarting**

- **Clear Outputs:** Removes outputs from all cells without resetting the context.
- **Restart:** Resets the notebook environment, clearing all variables and contexts.

#### **5. Understanding Execution Behavior**

- Code execution progress is indicated by a running icon (`...`) in the cell.
- Long-running code (e.g., `time.sleep(10)`) will show the progress until completion.
  - Avoid interrupting execution to ensure stability.

#### **6. Single-Line vs. Multi-Line Code**

- Single-line code (e.g., variable assignment, print statements) is demonstrated in individual cells.
- Multi-line code, such as function definitions, will be explored in the next lecture.

### **Next Steps**

The upcoming lecture will delve into writing **multi-line code** in cells, such as defining functions, and demonstrate how to invoke these functions effectively within the notebook environment.
