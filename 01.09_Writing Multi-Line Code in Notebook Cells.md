## Writing Multi-Line Code in Notebook Cells

This lecture focuses on working with **multi-line code** in notebook cells, specifically defining and using functions in the VS Code notebook environment. It also covers managing cell execution, understanding the order of execution, and best practices for maintaining a clean notebook.

### Key Takeaways:

#### **1. Multi-Line Code in Notebook Cells**

- **Defining Functions:**
  - Functions can be defined in a cell and invoked in subsequent cells.
  - Example: A function `sum_n` computes the sum of integers from `1` to `n` using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`.

```python
def sum_n(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

- **Viewing Function Details:**
  - Running the function name (e.g., `sum_n`) shows its signature.
  - Appending a `?` (e.g., `sum_n?`) displays additional details, including the docstring (if provided).

#### **2. Execution Behavior**

- **Order of Execution Matters:**

  - Cells must be executed in the correct order for dependent cells to work.
  - If a cell that defines a function or variable isn't executed, subsequent cells referencing it will fail.

- **Memory Retention:**
  - If a cell defining a function is deleted, the function remains in memory until the notebook is restarted.
  - Restarting the notebook clears all variables, functions, and context from memory.

#### **3. Managing Cells**

- **Reordering Cells:**

  - Cells can be reordered by dragging them to adjust the sequence.
  - Ensure that function or variable definitions precede their usage when running the notebook sequentially.

- **Running All Cells:**
  - Use **"Run All"** to execute all cells in the correct order.
  - Restart the notebook and clear all outputs before running to ensure a clean state.

#### **4. Best Practices**

- **Keep Notebooks Clean:**

  - Avoid unnecessary cells.
  - Use clear and concise code snippets.
  - Organize cells logically to ensure ease of understanding.

- **Restarting and Validating:**

  - Restart the notebook and clear outputs before sharing or reviewing.
  - Run all cells from top to bottom to validate functionality.

- **Documenting with Markdown:**
  - Use markdown cells for explanations and documentation to make the notebook reader-friendly.

### Example Workflow for Multi-Line Code:

1. **Define a Function:**

   ```python
   def sum_n(n):
       """Returns the sum of integers from 1 to n."""
       return n * (n + 1) // 2
   ```

   Run this cell to define the function.

2. **Invoke the Function:**

   ```python
   print(sum_n(4))  # Output: 10
   ```

3. **Restart Notebook:**

   - Clear outputs and restart to ensure the notebook is clean.

4. **Run All Cells:**
   - Use **"Run All"** to execute cells in sequence and validate the output.

### Final Notes:

This lecture emphasized:

- The importance of cell order and execution.
- Best practices for a clean and organized notebook.
- Using functions effectively in a notebook environment.

By following these guidelines, you can efficiently use notebooks to learn and practice Python.
