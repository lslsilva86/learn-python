## Using Loops and Conditionals with Python Lists

---

#### **1. Overview**

In this lecture, we explored how to use **for loops** and **if conditions** with Python lists, which are integral to data processing. By using these constructs, we iterated through lists and applied conditional logic to filter and process data.

---

#### **2. Revisiting Python Lists**

Here are the three example lists we worked with:

```python
# List of integers
sales = [200, 300, 183, 142]

# List of strings
cities = ["Dallas", "Frisco", "Hyderabad", "Bangalore"]

# Mixed data types in a list
score = [75, 80, 95, None, "absent", 65]
```

---

#### **3. Using Loops**

- **Basic Iteration**:

  ```python
  for city in cities:
      print(city)
  ```

- **Accessing List Elements with Loops**:
  Example: Printing the length of each city name.
  ```python
  for city in cities:
      print(f"Length of {city} is {len(city)}")
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Length of Dallas is 6
  Length of Frisco is 6
  Length of Hyderabad is 9
  Length of Bangalore is 9
  ```

---

#### **4. Using Conditionals in Loops**

- **Filtering Data with `if` Statements**:
  Example: Printing only numeric values from the `score` list.

  ```python
  for value in score:
      if isinstance(value, int):  # Check if the element is an integer
          print(value)
  ```

- **Processing Data Based on Conditions**:
  Example: Calculating the total score by filtering out non-integer values.
  ```python
  total_score = 0
  for value in score:
      if isinstance(value, int):  # Check if the element is an integer
          total_score += value
  print(total_score)  # Output: 315
  ```

---

#### **5. Combining Loops and Conditionals**

- Example: Processing a list to perform specific actions based on element types.
  ```python
  for value in score:
      if isinstance(value, int):
          print(f"Integer: {value}")
      elif value is None:
          print("No score available")
      elif isinstance(value, str):
          print(f"Status: {value}")
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Integer: 75
  Integer: 80
  Integer: 95
  No score available
  Status: absent
  Integer: 65
  ```

---

#### **6. Important Concepts**

- **Indentation**:

  - Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.
  - For a block within a `for` loop or `if` statement, ensure it is consistently indented.

  ```python
  for value in score:
      if isinstance(value, int):
          print(value)
  ```

- **String Formatting**:
  Use `f-strings` for readable and dynamic string output.

  ```python
  print(f"Length of {city} is {len(city)}")
  ```

- **Error Handling with Mixed Data Types**:
  If you attempt unsupported operations (e.g., `sum(score)`), Python raises an exception. Use conditionals to filter valid elements before performing operations.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways**

1. **For Loops**: Useful for iterating through collections like lists.
2. **Conditionals**: Allow filtering and processing elements based on specific criteria.
3. **Dynamic Use**: Combining loops and conditionals enables solving real-world problems such as filtering invalid data or performing aggregate operations on collections.

---

#### **8. Real-World Use Case**

Imagine processing sales data where some records are incomplete. You can filter out incomplete or invalid records using loops and conditionals, ensuring only valid data contributes to computations like totals or averages.

---

#### **9. Next Steps**

The next lecture will introduce **list comprehensions** and more Pythonic ways of handling collections, which are often more efficient and concise than using traditional loops and conditionals.
