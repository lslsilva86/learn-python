## Setting Up a VS Code Workspace and Python Virtual Environment

This lecture explains how to create a **VS Code workspace** for Python revision and set up a **Python virtual environment** to manage project dependencies. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to integrate the Python virtual environment with VS Code and validate the setup by creating and running a simple Python program.

### **Key Steps**

1. **Creating a VS Code Workspace**

   - Navigate to `File > Open Folder` in VS Code.
   - Create a new folder (e.g., `PythonRevision`) to act as the workspace.
   - Select the folder to set it up as the active workspace in VS Code.

2. **Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment**

   - Open the terminal in VS Code.
   - Check the Python version using the command: `python --version`.
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv pr-venv
     ```
   - This creates a virtual environment folder (`pr-venv`) within the workspace.

3. **Integrating the Virtual Environment with VS Code**

   - Use the **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
   - Search for and select **Python: Select Interpreter**.
   - Choose the Python interpreter from the virtual environment (`pr-venv`).

4. **Validating the Virtual Environment**

   - Open a new terminal in VS Code to confirm the virtual environment is automatically activated.
   - Create a Python file (e.g., `hello_world.py`) outside the `pr-venv` folder.
   - Write a simple Python script, such as:
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```
   - Save the file and run it using **Run Python File in Terminal**. Verify the output.

5. **Best Practices**
   - Avoid creating or adding files directly inside the virtual environment folder.
   - Use the virtual environment to install dependencies for the project using pip.

### **Future Steps**

- Learn to seamlessly integrate Jupyter notebooks into VS Code to use notebooks directly within the IDE, enhancing the learning and revision experience.

This setup ensures a clean and isolated Python environment for development and allows for efficient Python learning and project development.
